## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Reaching the next level in any activity usually demands one-on-one coaching, providing real-time objective analysis of desired metrics such as speed or efficiency of movement. Such assistance can also provide records of achievement by tracking average progress over time. Personal trainers or even group lessons can be expensive and reduce the consumer‚Äôs schedule flexibility.

The problem of progress tracking in physical activities is not new. Fitbit Trackers feature heart-rate tracking, hourly activity, calories burned, etc. for casual exercises and general health. These solutions, while widely used, require the user to avert their attention away from their activity and surroundings to view their progress. Most of these similarly accessible products target activities with a large user base, which leaves more niche sports, such as skiing or snowboarding, with less specialized means to track user performance. A device that measures important metrics real-time for snow sporting enthusiasts is therefore desired.

Our solution is a pair of snow sport goggles that provide the user with real time metrics and the ability to locate a skiing partner through augmented reality. This product will provide the ability to track current and average speed, distance traveled, time spent skiing, and average incline for runs as toggleable metrics all on a heads up display. In an attempt to make the skiing experience as seamless and informative as possible, we have designed our product to help the user have fun and stay safe.
